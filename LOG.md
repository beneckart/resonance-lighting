## 2026-05-18 — Ben + Codex — Standalone Atom recovered on new subnet

The standalone Atom Matrix + DFRobot DFR0559 stack appeared unreachable from the dashboard at its old address `192.168.4.250`. After Ben moved it from the DFR0559 output to direct USB, serial confirmed it was healthy and connected to `BubbyNet`, but DHCP had assigned `192.168.5.32`.

Serial report:

- Board: `m5stack_atom`
- MAC: `F8:B3:B7:1B:51:08`
- Fixture ID: `1B5108`
- Reset reason: `poweron`
- Previous firmware: `smoke-2026-05-15.7`
- WiFi IP: `192.168.5.32`

OTA-updated the Atom to `smoke-2026-05-18.2` at `192.168.5.32` and updated the local COTS mode dashboard from the stale `192.168.4.250` address. The board was warm while powered from the DFR0559 even with LEDs off; no firmware fault was visible over USB. Follow up with SEN0291 current measurements on the DFR0559 5 V output before leaving that stack powered unattended.

## 2026-05-18 — Ben + Codex — NeoHEX center-cluster mapping adjustment

Ben observed that Atom + NeoHEX mode `3` appeared as a single seven-LED column. The placeholder NeoHEX crop used contiguous indices `15..21`, which confirms the NeoHEX chain appears to be indexed by hex columns rather than by a rectangular 3x3 layout.

Updated the Atom + NeoHEX crop for `smoke-2026-05-18.2` to use a first-pass center hex cluster around center index `18`: `11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25`. Built the Atom + NeoHEX variant and OTA-flashed `192.168.4.27`; the board came back as `smoke-2026-05-18.2`, and `/mode?m=3` succeeded.

Network scan found the reachable smoke boards at `192.168.4.27`, `192.168.4.248`, and `192.168.4.249`. The standalone Atom + DFRobot DFR0559 stack at prior address `192.168.4.250` remains unreachable; likely next checks are DFR0559 ON jumper position, battery/output recovery via BOOT, supply stability, and then USB serial recovery if needed.

## 2026-05-18 — Ben + Codex — Atom + NeoHEX smoke-test variant

Fourth COTS prototype connected over USB: M5Stack Atom Matrix v1.1 on an Atomic Battery Base, connected to M5Stack Unit NeoHEX over Grove.

Added a compile-time smoke-test variant for Atom + NeoHEX:

- Build flag: `--build-property compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DRES_ATOM_GROVE_NEOHEX=1`
- Board name: `m5stack_atom_neohex`
- NeoPixel data pin: GPIO26, matching the Atom Grove yellow signal wire.
- Pixel count: 37.
- Initial center index assumption: 18.

USB-flashed the new Atom over `/dev/ttyUSB0`. It reported MAC `14:08:08:55:BA:78`, fixture ID `55BA78`, and joined home WiFi at `192.168.4.27`. The OTA web page reports `smoke-2026-05-18.1`, board `m5stack_atom_neohex`, and mode `0`. Verified `/mode?m=2` then `/mode?m=0` over HTTP.

Also OTA-updated the reachable C6 + IS31FL3741 board and FeatherS2 Neo board to `smoke-2026-05-18.1`. The original standalone Atom Matrix at `192.168.4.250` was not reachable during this pass and remains to be updated when powered/reconnected.

Updated the local COTS mode dashboard to include Atom + NeoHEX, and added the new stack to the LED measurement worksheet. The existing C6, FeatherS2, and regular Atom smoke-test builds still compile.

## 2026-05-15 — Ben + Codex — Brightness calibration fix for smoke-test modes

Ben observed that several LED measurement modes were effectively invisible, especially on the Atom Matrix: `4` full-low was invisible, `5` capped full-array was extremely faint, and `1` center was too dim. Root cause was double dimming on NeoPixel boards: low RGB component values were also being multiplied by low `Adafruit_NeoPixel::setBrightness()` values, causing integer scaling to round many channels down to 0 or 1. The IS31FL3741 full-low mode also used RGB values below RGB565's low-end quantization threshold.

Updated `firmware/smoke_test/` to `smoke-2026-05-15.7`:

- NeoPixel measurement modes now use `setBrightness(255)` and control current with explicit low raw RGB values.
- IS31FL3741 modes now avoid RGB565 values that quantize to black.
- Mode `1`, `3`, `4`, and `5` brightness levels were raised while keeping capped full-array modes conservative.

Built and OTA-flashed `.7` to all three unplugged boards over WiFi. All three returned to mode `0`, and `/mode?m=5` then `/mode?m=0` succeeded on C6 + IS31FL3741, FeatherS2 Neo, and Atom Matrix.

## 2026-05-15 — Ben + Codex — Static COTS mode dashboard

Added `ops/bench/cots-mode-dashboard.html`, a local static dashboard for the three active smoke-test boards:

- C6 + IS31FL3741 at `192.168.4.248`
- FeatherS2 Neo at `192.168.4.249`
- Atom Matrix at `192.168.4.250`

The page sends `/mode?m=<mode>` commands by iframe navigation rather than `fetch()`, so it works from a local `file://` page without requiring CORS headers from the ESP web server. It includes per-board and all-board controls for modes `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `q`, plus embedded board status iframes.

## 2026-05-15 — Ben + Codex — OTA and USB flash timing benchmarks

Ben ordered 12 DFRobot SEN0291 I2C digital wattmeters, so manual USB power-meter experiments are on hold until they arrive. Added a TODO item to integrate the wattmeters into the power-test harness/worksheets.

Ran first flash timing benchmarks on `smoke-2026-05-15.6`; details are in `docs/tests/OTA_FLASH_BENCHMARKS_2026-05-15.md`.

Results:

- Strict sequential OTA, waiting for each board to be reachable again: 44.123 s for 3 boards.
- Parallel OTA batch: 18.291 s for all 3 boards to upload and become reachable again.
- USB upload, excluding compile time: C6 7.109 s upload / 10.188 s ready; FeatherS2 Neo 13.047 s upload / 16.218 s ready; Atom Matrix 14.287 s upload / 17.515 s ready.

FeatherS2 had one failed USB reset/upload attempt (`Errno 71`) that left it in the ESP32-S2 bootloader; a recovery USB upload succeeded, and a subsequent normal USB upload also succeeded. All three boards are back online at `smoke-2026-05-15.6`, mode `0`.

## 2026-05-15 — Ben + Codex — LED measurement firmware loaded on COTS smoke boards

Extended `firmware/smoke_test/` into a deterministic LED measurement harness and bumped it to `smoke-2026-05-15.6`.

New serial/HTTP measurement modes:

- `q` — quiet baseline: stop OTA/WiFi and clear LEDs.
- `0` — LEDs off, current WiFi/OTA state unchanged.
- `1` — center dim warm white.
- `2` — 3-pixel RGB fringe.
- `3` — center 3x3 dim warm white.
- `4` — full-array very-low white.
- `5` — full-array capped white, brief measurements only.

The OTA status page now shows the active mode and exposes `/mode?m=<mode>` links, so the USB current meter workflow can use either serial commands or `curl` while WiFi OTA is active. Added `docs/tests/COTS_LED_MEASUREMENTS_2026-05-15.md` as the worksheet for current and optics readings.

Built and uploaded `smoke-2026-05-15.6` over HTTP OTA to all three connected boards:

- C6 + IS31FL3741: `192.168.4.248`
- FeatherS2 Neo: `192.168.4.249`
- M5Stack Atom Matrix: `192.168.4.250`

All three served `Version: smoke-2026-05-15.6`, accepted `/mode?m=1`, and were left in mode `0` with LEDs off and OTA still available. LED-current readings are still open; record them in the new worksheet.

## 2026-05-15 — Ben + Codex — Home-WiFi web OTA validated on all three COTS smoke boards

Committed and pushed the initial smoke-test baseline as `f36595e Add COTS smoke test firmware`.

Added station-mode web OTA support to `firmware/smoke_test/`:

- `wifi_secrets.h` is now ignored by git.
- `wifi_secrets.h.example` documents the local secrets format.
- Serial command `w` connects to configured WiFi and starts the same web updater.
- Serial command `o` still starts temporary AP OTA mode.
- `RES_WIFI_AUTO_CONNECT` allows bench firmware to enter WiFi OTA maintenance mode on boot.
- The web updater page now reports board, fixture ID, and firmware version.

Created a local ignored `wifi_secrets.h` for Ben's home WiFi and USB-flashed `smoke-2026-05-15.3` to all three boards as the WiFi-enabled OTA baseline. All three connected to the home WiFi and started web OTA:

- C6 + IS31FL3741: `192.168.4.248`
- FeatherS2 Neo: `192.168.4.249`
- M5Stack Atom Matrix: `192.168.4.250`

Then built `smoke-2026-05-15.4` and uploaded the app binaries over HTTP OTA to all three boards:

- `curl -F firmware=@/tmp/res-c6-ota/smoke_test.ino.bin http://192.168.4.248/update`
- `curl -F firmware=@/tmp/res-feathers2neo-ota/smoke_test.ino.bin http://192.168.4.249/update`
- `curl -F firmware=@/tmp/res-atom-ota/smoke_test.ino.bin http://192.168.4.250/update`

All three returned `Update complete. Rebooting.` and reconnected, serving `Version: smoke-2026-05-15.4` from their OTA web pages.

Open follow-up: `RES_WIFI_AUTO_CONNECT` is convenient for bench testing but should stay off in committed examples and production-like firmware. Production should enter OTA only in explicit maintenance mode.

## 2026-05-15 — Ben + Codex — COTS smoke firmware built, flashed, and serial-verified

Added `firmware/smoke_test/`, an Arduino CLI smoke-test sketch for the first three COTS prototypes. It builds for:

- `esp32:esp32:adafruit_feather_esp32c6:CDCOnBoot=cdc,PartitionScheme=min_spiffs`
- `esp32:esp32:um_feathers2neo:PartitionScheme=min_spiffs`
- `esp32:esp32:m5stack_atom:PartitionScheme=min_spiffs`

The sketch prints a serial boot report, MAC-derived fixture ID, reset reason, heap, OTA partition labels, board pin summary, I2C scan results, and a conservative LED test. It also includes a serial-command-triggered temporary AP web updater (`o` command) for future OTA smoke testing without hard-coded WiFi credentials.

Installed Arduino libraries needed for the smoke pass: Adafruit IS31FL3741 Library 1.2.3, Adafruit BusIO 1.17.4, Adafruit GFX Library 1.12.6. Existing Adafruit NeoPixel 1.15.4 is used for the built-in 5x5 matrices.

All three boards were flashed and serial-verified:

- Adafruit Feather ESP32-C6 + IS31FL3741: firmware `smoke-2026-05-15.2`, MAC `58:E6:C5:E4:1B:2C`, fixture ID `E41B2C`, I2C devices `0x30` (IS31FL3741) and `0x36` (likely onboard battery monitor), IS31 initialized, OTA partition `app0`.
- FeatherS2 Neo: firmware `smoke-2026-05-15.2`, MAC `48:27:E2:57:0D:32`, fixture ID `570D32`, built-in 25-pixel matrix on GPIO21, no I2C devices found, OTA partition `app0`.
- M5Stack Atom Matrix: firmware `smoke-2026-05-15.2`, MAC `F8:B3:B7:1B:51:08`, fixture ID `1B5108`, built-in 25-pixel matrix on GPIO27, no I2C devices found, OTA partition `app0`.

Notes:

- Arduino builds should not be run in parallel against the same sketch/cache; mixed RISC-V/Xtensa objects corrupted the Arduino cache. Sequential builds with explicit `--build-path` work.
- The smoke LED test intentionally limits both total lit pixels and PWM/global brightness. This matches the gobo/patterned-aperture direction and avoids M5Stack Atom Matrix full-brightness stress.
- End-to-end OTA upload through the temporary AP is implemented but not yet tested from a browser/client.

## 2026-05-15 — Ben + Codex — First COTS prototype USB inventory and interim C6 matrix path

Three COTS prototype boards arrived and were connected over USB for first bench bring-up:

- Adafruit Feather ESP32-C6 + Adafruit IS31FL3741 13x9 RGB LED matrix over STEMMA-QT. This is an interim substitute for the delayed PowerFeather matrix stack, useful for IS31FL3741 I2C, LED-current, OTA, and gobo/optics testing, but not a substitute for PowerFeather `VSQT`, LiFePO4 charging, fuel-gauge, sleep-current, or solar telemetry validation.
- M5Stack Atom Matrix with built-in 5x5 LEDs, USB-powered for now.
- UnexpectedMaker FeatherS2 Neo with built-in 5x5 LEDs, USB-powered for now.

USB/serial inventory on Ben's Linux bench:

- `/dev/ttyACM0` — UnexpectedMaker FeatherS2 Neo, USB VID:PID `303a:80b5`, serial `84722E75D023`, Arduino FQBN `esp32:esp32:um_feathers2neo`.
- `/dev/ttyACM1` — Adafruit Feather ESP32-C6 via Espressif USB JTAG/serial, USB VID:PID `303a:1001`, serial `58:E6:C5:E4:1B:2C`, Arduino FQBN `esp32:esp32:adafruit_feather_esp32c6`.
- `/dev/ttyUSB0` — M5Stack Atom Matrix via FT232, USB VID:PID `0403:6001`, serial `8D529F3938`, Arduino FQBN `esp32:esp32:m5stack_atom`.

Local tool state: Arduino CLI is installed with `esp32:esp32` core 3.3.7. No repo firmware exists yet beyond architecture docs. No firmware was flashed during this inventory pass.

Immediate test direction: create a small USB smoke/OTA bring-up firmware before broader firmware architecture work. It should print board ID, MAC-derived fixture ID, reset reason, build version, LED driver status, I2C scan results where applicable, and OTA status. Use LiPo-only DFRobot DFR0559 tests for now and do not connect LiFePO4 to LiPo-only boards.

## 2026-05-06 — Ben + Claude (Cowork) — Pre-share cleanup pass

Final cleanup before pushing the repo to GitHub and sharing with Steve and the wider team:

- **Bamboo "cone" → "lantern" / "cylinder".** The bamboo piece is geometrically a cylinder with a steam-bent flared skirt at the bottom, not a cone. The only cone-shaped object in the project is the experimental projective-geometry filter / gobo. Scrubbed every "bamboo cone" reference across BACKGROUND, ROADMAP, README, AGENTS, glossary, ADR 0007, hardware/references, ops/bom, enclosure README. Gobo "cone" references preserved.
- **Agent-neutral voice.** Rewrote BACKGROUND.md from a Ben-addressed narrative into a third-person project-context document. Replaced "Ben (you)" with "Ben Eckart" throughout. Replaced "Dad" with "Steve Eckart" outside this LOG file.
- **Scrubbed historical / distracting context** from active docs. Removed "Critical dates" stale-deadline table from BACKGROUND. Removed crossed-out resolved items from TODO and ROADMAP. The narrative of "we initially thought X, then learned Y" now lives only in this LOG; active docs present the current state cleanly.
- **New ADR 0009 — Minimize per-fixture operations at scale (O(1), not O(N)).** Captured Ben's strong constraint that anything done per-fixture is multiplied by 100. Specifies: no soldering on receipt; same firmware for every fixture; per-unit identity from MAC; investigate JLCPCB pre-flash service; design pogo-pin flashing jig as fallback. Reinforced in `README.md`, `hardware/README.md`, `TODO.md`. This is now the ninth and (so far) final ADR.

After this pass, the active docs (`README`, `AGENTS`, `BACKGROUND`, `TODO`, `ROADMAP`, `SYSTEM`, ADRs, glossary) read as a clean shared documentation set for Ben + Steve + future AI agents + the wider Resonance team. The journey from "what is this project" through "let's design solar lights" to "modular hat with LiFePO4 carrier board with O(1) ops" lives in this LOG.

## 2026-05-06 — Ben + Claude (Cowork) — Logistics flow confirmed: air-ship to TN, integrate at Grass Valley

Big risk-register item resolved: **Bamboo Pure is air-shipping a small batch of prototype bamboo lanterns to Steve in Tennessee.** Electronics workstream is fully decoupled from the May 10 Bali sea container. The end-to-end logistics flow:

1. Bali → TN: prototype lanterns by air for early mechanical prototyping (Phase 2).
2. Bali → Grass Valley, CA: tree structure + remaining bamboo by sea container.
3. Ben (CA): designs PCB, ships to Steve.
4. Steve (TN): finalizes hat enclosure with both bamboo and PCB in hand.
5. Steve → Ben (TN → CA): ships 100 hats.
6. Ben → Grass Valley: drives hats + electronics to meet the bamboo container at the staging area.
7. Grass Valley: final integration. Truck to BRC.

**Updated docs:**

- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Phase 2 dependencies, Phase 6 rewritten as cross-country logistics + Grass Valley integration, risk register marked resolved, open dependencies list updated.
- `TODO.md` — removed urgency on "catch Elliot before Bali," removed ship-path decision (resolved), added air-ship-timing confirmation.

**What this changes practically:**

- Phase 2 (mechanical prototyping) can start as soon as bamboo arrives in TN, not when Elliot returns from Bali.
- Phase 5 production fab no longer races a container deadline.
- Phase 6 is a cross-country logistics piece with TN → CA → Grass Valley flow rather than US → BRC direct.
- Grass Valley pre-build staging area is now the canonical "integration site" terminology.

## 2026-05-06 — Ben + Claude (Cowork) — Roadmap, power-budget correction, prototyping strategy

Three additions:

**`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — phases 0–10, working backward from BM 2026 (late August). Phase 1 (TTGO bench prototype) starts 2026-05-07 and runs ~3 weeks. Phase 3 (custom carrier board v1) lands ~2026-07-01. Phase 5 (production fab) ~2026-08-01. Risk register and open dependencies on team included.

**Prototyping strategy clarification.** The "validate the architecture before committing to LiFePO4 silicon" risk is fully mitigated by Phase 1 — using the **TTGO T-Beam (with its built-in TP4056 LiPo charger)** as the LiPo prototype platform. No intermediate "LiPo carrier board" needed — that would add a board spin without de-risking anything Phase 1 doesn't already cover. The CN3058 LiFePO4 charger circuit is the only chemistry-specific portion; we lift its reference circuit from datasheet, AI-review, and validate on Phase 3 v1 board with MCP73123 as designed-in fallback. (Captured in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, not yet a separate ADR — promote to ADR if revisited.)

**Power budget correction.** Earlier estimate assumed "4 WS2812B all on at once" yielding ~10 mA LED average. Actual usage model is **1–9 LEDs per fixture, typically 1–3 lit at a time** (default ambient = 1 LED at 10%, showy = 3 LEDs at 30%, wand-burst = 9 LEDs full but rare and brief). Per-LED current scales linearly per WS2812B datasheet — confirmed against 2018 Talisman v2 measurements on the 16-LED ring (500 mA / 16 = 31 mA per LED at full white, matching). Updated `docs/block-diagram/SYSTEM.md`:

- Per-LED reference table replaces "4-LED ring" table.
- Time-weighted nightly LED current ~5 mA (vs. 10 mA estimated earlier).
- Total daily drain ~120 mAh (vs. 170 mAh).
- Panel sizing recommendation now 1–2 W (vs. 2 W); 1 W is sufficient.
- Battery: 18650 still preferred for 12-night autonomy and 2-year life; 14430 (~3 nights) now reasonable if cell sourcing forces it.
- BOM updated for 1–9 LED count per fixture.

## 2026-05-06 — Ben + Claude (Cowork) — Handoff documents

Before switching to Claude Code for daily iteration, dumped context to handoff-friendly artifacts so future agents (Ben's Claude Code, Steve's Claude Code, Elliot's Co-Work, future Cowork sessions) can pick up cold:

- `AGENTS.md` at root — explicit preamble for any agent picking up this repo. Read order, who's working, what's known vs assumed, what the repo does NOT cover, when to ask Ben.
- `docs/block-diagram/SYSTEM.md` — the canonical system architecture. ASCII block diagram, voltage rails, current draw table grounded in 2018 Talisman v2 measurements + ESP32-C3 datasheet, single-fixture daily power budget (~170 mAh/night, well covered by 2 W panel + 1500 mAh 18650), back-of-envelope max-stress check for wand-interaction events. Cost-comparison sketch vs `INV_2026_00401`.
- `docs/decisions/` — eight ADRs: ESP32-C3-MINI-1 (0001), LiFePO4 chemistry (0002), CN3058 charger (0003), ESP-NOW mesh (0004), FreeRTOS task architecture (0005), custom PCB not dev-board-on-carrier (0006), modular hat enclosure (0007), WS2812B from Vbat with no level shifter (0008).
- `firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md` — RTOS task decomposition (`led_render_task`, `ca_tick_task`, `mesh_tx_task`, `mesh_rx callback`, `housekeeping_task`), inter-task communication via FreeRTOS queues + atomic shared state, sleep behavior, boot sequence, OTA strategy.
- `hardware/atopile/EXAMPLE.md` — sample atopile module (`voltage_regulator.ato` for the AP2112K-3.3 LDO) so the schematic-as-code pattern is concrete. List of modules to build.
- `ops/bom.md` — first-pass BOM grouped by carrier-board electronics, non-PCB electronics, and mechanical. Per-fixture target ~$23. 100-fixture total ~$2,310.
- `docs/glossary.md` — proper nouns and acronyms for new agents dropping in cold.

These files are now the canonical project context outside this conversation. The earlier `BACKGROUND.md` remains the long-form narrative.

Switching to Claude Code from here. Cowork retains read access to this repo via GitHub (when pushed) for review and project management.

## 2026-05-06 — Ben + Claude (Cowork) — Repo bootstrap

Stood up this repo. Ported `BACKGROUND.md` from earlier Cowork session — captures full project context, team, decisions to date, prior-art lessons from 2018 Talisman v2 build, code reusable from `beneckart/future-robotics`, and the design space for this year (electronics architecture, mandala filter program, mesh creative possibilities).

Decisions baked in so far (subject to team review):

- **MCU:** ESP32-C3-MINI-1 for production. Prototype on TTGO T-Beam and T-Ice modules already in Steve's workshop.
- **Battery chemistry:** LiFePO4. Chosen for thermal tolerance in desert deployment.
- **Charger IC:** CN3058 (LiFePO4-tuned, JLCPCB basic part, ~$0.30). Rejected TP4056, bq24074, CN3791 — all LiPo-tuned, wrong charge profile.
- **3.3 V LDO:** AP2112K-3.3 (450 mV dropout, JLCPCB basic part, fits LiFePO4's 2.5–3.6 V range).
- **LEDs:** 1–4 WS2812B per fixture, powered direct from battery rail (3.3 V GPIO satisfies WS2812B's 0.7 × Vcc threshold per Talisman v2 verification).
- **Mesh:** ESP-NOW. No infrastructure required at BRC.
- **OTA:** required from day one. One USB-C flash per device, then over-the-air forever.
- **Enclosure:** sealed 3D-printed solar "hat" that sits partially inside / partially over the bamboo cone top. Set screws absorb bamboo dimensional variability.

Open team-side questions (see `BACKGROUND.md` and `TODO.md` for full list):

- Rope attachment point: hat, bamboo, or hybrid. Pending Vishnu / Ed / Elliot.
- Container vs separate ship for electronics. Bamboo ships from Bali 2026-05-10.
- Hat dimensions confirmation to Vishnu so he can finalize renders.
- INV_2026_00401 cost decomposition.

Next concrete steps for Ben + Steve:

1. System block diagram + power budget (highest-leverage upstream artifact).
2. atopile module library: `solar_input`, `lifepo4_charger`, `power_path`, `voltage_regulator`, `esp32_module`, `led_output`. Build each from reference schematics.
3. Bench validation on existing TTGO modules — solar charging path first.

Switching to Claude Code for daily firmware/hardware iteration. Cowork retains read access to this repo via GitHub for project management and review.
